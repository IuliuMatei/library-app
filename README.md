This is my first big project I am building with the help of an Udemy course.

This will be a library web app, where you can search books, checkout them and leave reviews.

For frontend I am using react.

For backend I am using Springboot. There, I created packeges for entities, for repositories 
to provide an abstraction layer for data access, encapsulating data access logic and offering 
a standardized querying interface for interacting with data sources, the services to to encapsulate 
business logic, orchestrate interactions between multiple repositories, request models to to encapsulate
and structure incoming data from clients, ensuring a consistent and predictable format for processing 
within the application, promoting maintainability, readability, and reducing coupling between the 
presentation and business layers and the DataRest configuration to disable POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH
http methods.
